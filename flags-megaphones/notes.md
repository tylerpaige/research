## Gustav Klutsis
- It's probably obvious, but it may be worth looking into what exactly Gustav Klutsis what thinking about when we made his drawings/maquette of loudspeakers and kiosks. 
- From his Wikipedia article: _"His first project of note, in 1922, was a series of semi-portable multimedia agitprop kiosks to be installed on the streets of Moscow, integrating "radio-orators", film screens, and newsprint displays, all to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Revolution."_
