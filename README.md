# Project Research and Notes
This is a collection of images and documents that are used as research for future art projects. This is also a first attempt to organize my thoughts into a more comprehensive structure than a notebook. I anticipate this collection to eventually become scattered and hard to piece together; but I am interested in sharing my progress with my peers in a way that emulates how I am personally organizing [i.e. I am using a file directory structure and I'd rather not port that structure to something like a blog].

I am also interested in letting others take from this repo and work in parallel or divergent ways. Maybe a conversation can start if we are thinking about similar things.

I will try my best to keep everything in this archive up-to-date and properly documented.
