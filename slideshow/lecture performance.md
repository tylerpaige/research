# Lecture Performances
Last term in Hito Steyerl's class at the Universität der Künste, the students studied and created "lecture performances". Although I wasn't present, if my impressions are correct, this format is really exciting. I have been hyping up slideshow club as a platform, and it turns out this is a real art form.

From what I can tell, a lecture performance is a performance of research project aided by a projection (usually a slideshow). The performance takes on the tone of a lecture or seminar (didactic, maybe) as a base, and it adds performative elements. So far, the name is pretty self explanatory. Rather than beat the point to death, here is a copy of the Lensbased Wiki (Hito's class's wiki) page that collects examples of lecture performances.
