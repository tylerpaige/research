# Slides, Slideshows, Slideshow Club

This folder contains thoughts about slideshows as a format for art. This includes:
- Slideshow club
- Lecture performances
- Printed slideshow (look at Powerpoint's print methods)
- Videos strung together with "Powerpoint transitions"
- "_Powerpointesque_" interfaces (see below)

This format, I think, is underutilized in art and performance.

## Quick thoughts on advantages
- Good for performance, good for distribution
- Works for the type of "web art" I am looking to do: not an "interface", but more of a video as a website (moving parts, brief interaction, with the primary focus being "watching")
- Meshes well with my method of thinking (this → this → this; linear progression of ideas).
-- This could also be bad. Does not allow for branching in ideas.
-- Maybe it could, though. Think of Jay's presentation for Hani. It was "slideshow" format, but you could also go up and down and branch out of the linear progression. In distribution, the user is able to do this all on their own. In performance, the performer could feed off of audience reception.
- On a similar note, good for narrative

## Jumping off points
- Maybe good ground for experimentation would be the Ringwood Manor Windows series (more to come later)
