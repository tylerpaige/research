# Slide Shows
by Charlotte Cheetham (of [manystuff](http://www.manystuff.org/)) in conjunction with Fillip's Institutions by Artists conference

"Slideshows is an initiative begun in 2012 in conjunction with Fillip's Institutions by Artists conference, which takes the form of a series of video self-portraits hosted on Tumblr.

"With the sequential rhythm of the pages of a book, the following slideshows depict portraits of publishers, artists, designers, booksellers, and other working in the contemporary field of independent publishing, and, particularly, in what is called today the artist's book* This set gives form to one possible look at this field, staging the printed work and research of some of its leading figures.

"Through the familiar (nostalgic) format of consecutive captioned images, these slideshow videos are mobilized in the service of these characters, whose images and texts speak to a still developing landscape of practice—as if they anticipate the transmission of a still moving memory, thus captured for a moment.

"This partially decontextualized narrative space in which information is displayed in a state of silent diffusion (such as the book?) can be freely visit—alone, on a computer, or with others, in a less intimate space as was the case when the videos were initially present at the Institutions by Artists' Print Centre. It's a wink to the noxious zapping rhythm of information online—but here, presented so that its stories may be savoured, its collected archive is unpacked.

"Presented here is an index of the project, a pocket guide to what you will find online. This project will culminate in a printed volume that documents each Slide Show, available in late 2013. Enjoy!
