# Day 1
I've been thinking a lot about impermanence when it comes to text... About how a text can be altered, or maybe about the fluidity of meaning. My thoughts are all over the place, but here are some ideas. Some take a route towards historical revisionism (myth), other look at textual impermanence [*I've got to find a better phrase for that] formally: what a text looks like when it is changed or destroyed.

**OR** devising ways to hide the fact that a text has been changed.

**OR** embracing that a text can change (perhaps without notice or evidence) and creating a typeface that helps the modifier do so. I suppose this typeface would be a hand-written style.
- This seems quite foolish, though. The real ephemerality of text comes into play with digital text.
	* A wiki is changed
	* A hacker defaces a website
	* A purposefully sensational post on a political subreddit is changed *after* users comment/support, making the users look like fools or radicals
		- → Mirrors or snapshots are create to visualize this change, or at least provide a record of its past

I am also interested in version control, like Git. Edits are "nondestructive" because the past versions are all recoverable. Changes are ultra-visible. Git would have been a great art project. Part of me feels, though, that if I make work about version control, it would be pigeonholed into "transparency protest". 

Have I become so jaded that "creating the world we envision" seems hackneyed? 

# Day 2, RE: Handwriting vs Digital Text
I may be overlooking something interesting in the impermanence of written text, but truthfully my instinct is to do something digital. Maybe this is because my comfort-zone is in the digital realm, but it feels more appropriate to focus here. 

It does seem to be "more interesting"—I guess—to look at historical revisionism through digital capabilities: what does technology allow us to do to our past? On one hand, it is easy to remark how there is a file on everything, a record or evidence. We will likely continue down that path. But my interest, I think, at the point anyway, is in how all those traces are digital and therefore editable. Of course, there are permissions and digital signatures, but overall it seems like technology has given us a way to **forge history**. It's less about removing bits as much as it is changing what's there and **adding more** (saturating the market). 

I think what I really want to do is learn to be a hacker. I want to be able to upload my own files to the Library of Congress, or at least make a file look like it's coming from there. I want to create a data packet from scratch, to fake a digital signature. 

Maybe in overlooking written text, I am overlooking a huge vulnerability that could be exploited. Maybe so much time and energy is being put towards digital security that a physical change is more likely to go unnoticed. Using America as an example, though, this seems unlikely. The U.S. spends all of its money on a digital offensive but leaves its digital defenses weak. In that case, a digital change is perhaps "stealthier".

Another something-or-other I've been sitting on comes from summer 2012 when I was working at Munich Reinsurance. I am interested (and this falls outside of the textual impermanence thing) in the act of creating work within a place and the ownership of that work. What I create at work is under my authorship but not my ownership. 
> *"I created it, I own it*
> *VS*
> *I created it, you own the tool, you own it*
> *VS*
> *I created it, I own the tool, you own the subject, you own it*
> *VS*
> *I created it, I own the tool, you bought the subject, I could buy the subject, I could own something similar* 
> *VS*
> *I created it, you own it, fuck you"*

Partially, I think my interest in this comes from the idea of containers → something I have not worked out in the slighted. Literally, I am interested in things that are built to contain other things. 
1. Because it automatically assumes a position/role of power and hierarchy
2. Because it continues infinitely: this contains this, which contains this, which contains this, which ... ... ...
3. There is often one direction of flow (of information, of command, of power, etc.)

Maybe I'm more interested in containers as a symbol to incorporate into later works, like a stupid painter using ants. 

I think there are often interesting relationships between the container and the contents. Like how the container can stand **to represent the contents**, but not always the reverse. Or perhaps the idea of synecdoche in general. 

I also like the idea of an empty container, but I'm not if my interest in trying to be subversive or nihilistic. I mean, I'm not sure if I want to deceive people by **exploiting their expectation for a container to have relevant and appropriate contents**, or if I am expressing a perpetual dissatisfaction with discovering new containers in a descending chain, or that containers on different scopes may contradict one another. I.E. that it is hopeless (well... maybe not hopeless, but never-ending) to explore a chain of containers because you will never reach an end. Part of me finds this idea exciting, though (and this is perhaps how it ties into my interest in horizontality and the internet). Certainly the first idea is more interesting.
