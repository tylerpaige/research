### Arcosanti
- Paolo Soleri's utopian city to explore "arcology" (architecture + ecology)
- Arizone, 1970
- _"Existing structures at Arcosanti provide for the complete needs of the community. They include a five-story visitors' center/cafe/gift shop, a bronze-casting apse, a ceramics apse, two large barrel vaults, a ring of apartment residences and storefronts around an outdoor amphitheater, a community swimming pool, an office complex, and Soleri's suite. A two-bedroom "Sky Suite" occupies the highest point in the complex and is available for overnight guests. Most of the buildings have accessible roofs."_
- _"At present, the town is primarily an education center, with students from around the world visiting to attend workshops, classes, and continue construction. 40,000 tourists visit yearly"_
- _"The average salary at Arcosanti is minimum wage."_
