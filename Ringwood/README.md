# Ringwood

This folder contains documents that I will be using for a short photo essay. The essay will use a slideshow format. It will tell the story of looking for Green Camp, a nature retreat Cooper Union used to own.

In 2012 Angus Buchannan-Smith, Asher Mones, and I decided to track down Green Camp after it had been sold but not erased from Cooper's institutional memory. The place was present only in myth, and no current student really knew the specifics. 

We decided to search for Green Camp without the guide of older generations. We scoured the internet for archives, looks at Google Maps imaging, and more. We eventually found a location. 

We saved up money and gathered equipment to film a project in Green Camp. Once we navigated the surrounding area, we anxiously approached what we thought could be Green Camp, only to find the Ringwood Manorâ€”Peter Cooper's old mansion. Since his ownership, the state of New Jersey transformed the mansion into a museum. 

And when we arrived, the museum was closed indefinitely for repairs.
