# About this folder
This folder contains screenshots of how news organizations (New York Times, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, etc.) are organizing their website navigation. Each file is named with the organization's name and a brief description of their navigation system.

This research will be used in some sort of system of never-ending descending navigation. Recently, I've been struck with both an interest in the horizontality of internet organization and nihilism about the sheer extensivity of information. In some sort of way, I am interested in Kierkegaard's "The Present Age", in which he discusses the public press and its impact on inclusion/participation/effectiveness. Tentatively, I am interested in elaborating on Kierkegaard's points using the Internet as a jumping off point.

Initially, I am focusing on major news organizations, though at some point I will have to discuss the "mass amateurization of media" as Clay Shirky would call it.
