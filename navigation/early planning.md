# Thoughts on Navigation

## Immediate thoughts after doing a second drawing
- Does the this need to be an interface? Can it be a series of images of navigation? Maybe it should start that way (as if they were screenshots of the interface in play → who could tell the difference between documentation and interface?)
- I like everything in blue
- I should start collecting screenshots of different navigation systems for reference
	* Or should this be a thing done from memory? What am I really talking about here? Is this about a human system of organization in contrast to a machine system of organization? Or rather, how we organize information in our minds versus how we organize in an interface? Is this about usability? ↙ 
- I think, more conclusively, I'm interested in "intuition" when it comes to interfaces → that intuition is not "human nature" but rather a learned set of skills that must advance as interfaces change. You have to know the previous version to know the new one. You can't just jump right in (or, at least, it's very hard to do that). 
- I think this is closely related the Human Interference Task Force. I'm talking (or trying to, maybe) about changes/ephemerality in meaning (or *in systems*, really) 
- I also have something written about intuition that I wrote for IDS, and I think I should reference it. Those thoughts seemed important, and they kind of related to "the archive"
- Maybe a lot of my thoughts on the ephemerality of systems comes from the my predecessors' interest in the archive. I'm interested in how those archives, or those systems, are corrupted. I'm interested in how they can be changed, and skewed to mean something else. How a system shifts. 
- Obviously this can all be related back to Cooper and its changing mission, but why am I depicting it through information systems (specifically the Internet)? 
	* More universal?
	* The Internet is changing against its foundational ethics, too
	* 

- Should it even have text? What about just empty navigation? What if the text slowly faded away as the navigation recreated itself—leaving only the structure and not the content?
	*  No Ghost, Just The Shell
- Is this about the degradation of information? Is this about nihilism? 
- I know a lot of things I'm interested in, but I'm not sure I have any thoughts on them. 
- Also I feel like every time I get on a roll like this, someone interrupts me. I need to work in my bedroom.

There's a lot of background work done on relating Dadaist principles to the internet. I keep forgetting I've already done some work relating Kierkegaard and Sartre to the internet. 

Maybe this type of "making less sense" could be related to methods of taking down power systems/hierarchical power of information systems.
