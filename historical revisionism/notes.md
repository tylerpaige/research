# Historical Revisionism, basic notes

## Reasoning/In Support Of
- "Events are affected by pseudo-events, as reality is affected by illusion" (Richard H. Rovere for The New Yorker, as found in Martha Langford's "Some Uses of Disenchantment" for Fillip)
-- This is tangentially related. Rovere is talking about planned/staged publicity stunts and their efficacy.
-- This is the first time I have realized the connection between historical revisionism and the myth/limits of representation. It seems that the efficacy of the revision is directly related to the representation's believability. On the contrary, though, Langford seems to think that the believability doesn't have much to do with it ("_Of course_ it's staged"): instead we must "treat the products of photo ops as 'palimpsests'. We have to dig for the layers of meaning[...]".
- "Whenever in a memory the subject himself appears in this way as an object among other objects this contrast between the acting and the recollecting ego may be taken as evidence that the original impression has been worked over." (Freud, "Screen Memories", 1899)
-- That is, when the memory is the not from the first-person perspective but rather from an independent observer's perspective, the memory has been altered. 
-- We can take this one step farther: history edited to reflect an observer's perspective (perhaps a larger public or community) rather than the subject's perspective (perhaps the "victor").
-- "Participants report diminished emotion as they move from the centre of their tales to outside observers of their lives"
