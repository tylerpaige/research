# Notes on Isometric Perspective/Axonometric Projection

- "Within the frame of this graphic sheet, the skewed position of the axonometry detaches the represented building from its background, isolating it as an object and suggesting unrest – perhaps a state of weightless floating, or at least a disregard for gravity."

## "A Chinese Perspective for Cyberspace?"
### by Jan Krikke
#### Quotes 
> *"The Chinese developed axonometry, dengjiao toushi in Chinese, which translates as 'equal-angle see-through'"*
> *"Axonometry was used not only in wood block prints but also in the classic Chinese scrolls, the vertical hanging scrolls and the horizontal hand scrolls. Classic Chinese hand scroll were up to ten metres in length, and are viewed by unrolling them from right to left. Hand scrolls are based on a (pictorial) synthesis of space and time. Rather than having a 'subject', the scroll is based on a 'scenario'. For instance, a scroll may depict 'life along a river.' Upon unrolling the opening sequence of the scroll, we may see people boarding a boat on a river. As we unroll the scroll further, we see the boat cross a lake, navigate rapids in the river, stop at a small harbour, and lastly arrive at its destination at the sea shore. In other words, the scroll has taken the viewer through an experience in space and time. (Importantly, scrolls were not a collection of separate pictures, but rather a continuous and seamless visual image.)*
> *"Unlike linear perspective, axonometry has no vanishing point, and hence it does not assume a fixed position by the viewer. This makes axonometry 'scrollable'. Art historians often speak of the 'moving' or 'shifting' perspective in Chinese paintings."*
> *"In his book The Frozen Fountain, published in the 1930s, [Claude] Bragdon illustrated the spatial quality of isometry with an ingenious drawing (see Fig. 6). Bragdon gave isometry a glowing description. He wrote: 'Isometric perspective, less faithful to appearance, is more faithful to fact; it shows things nearly as they are known to the mind. Parallel lines are really parallel; there is no far and no near, the size of everything remains constant because all things are represented as being the same distance away and the eye of the spectator everywhere at once. When we imagine a thing, or strive to visualize it in the mind or memory, we do it in this way, without the distortion of ordinary perspective. Isometric perspective is therefore more intellectual, more archetypal, it more truly renders the mental image -- the thing seen by the mind's eye.'"*
