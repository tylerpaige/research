# Notes on Isometric Perspective/Axonometric Projection

- "Within the frame of this graphic sheet, the skewed position of the axonometry detaches the represented building from its background, isolating it as an object and suggesting unrest – perhaps a state of weightless floating, or at least a disregard for gravity."

## "A Chinese Perspective for Cyberspace?"
### by Jan Krikke
#### Quotes & Notes
> *"The Chinese developed axonometry, dengjiao toushi in Chinese, which translates as 'equal-angle see-through'"*
> *"Axonometry was used not only in wood block prints but also in the classic Chinese scrolls, the vertical hanging scrolls and the horizontal hand scrolls. Classic Chinese hand scroll were up to ten metres in length, and are viewed by unrolling them from right to left. Hand scrolls are based on a (pictorial) synthesis of space and time. Rather than having a 'subject', the scroll is based on a 'scenario'. For instance, a scroll may depict 'life along a river.' Upon unrolling the opening sequence of the scroll, we may see people boarding a boat on a river. As we unroll the scroll further, we see the boat cross a lake, navigate rapids in the river, stop at a small harbour, and lastly arrive at its destination at the sea shore. In other words, the scroll has taken the viewer through an experience in space and time. (Importantly, scrolls were not a collection of separate pictures, but rather a continuous and seamless visual image.)*
> *"Unlike linear perspective, axonometry has no vanishing point, and hence it does not assume a fixed position by the viewer. This makes axonometry 'scrollable'. Art historians often speak of the 'moving' or 'shifting' perspective in Chinese paintings."*
- There's a ton of interesting wordplay here when it is related to computers and digital imaging. The Chinese scroll is really similar to the webpage in every way described. When viewing a screen, it is often a similar condition of three dimensions being forced into two dimensions. Likewise, a proper webpage "does not assume a fixed position by the viewer". 
> *"In his book The Frozen Fountain, published in the 1930s, [Claude] Bragdon illustrated the spatial quality of isometry with an ingenious drawing (see Fig. 6). Bragdon gave isometry a glowing description. He wrote: 'Isometric perspective, less faithful to appearance, is more faithful to fact; it shows things nearly as they are known to the mind. Parallel lines are really parallel; there is no far and no near, the size of everything remains constant because all things are represented as being the same distance away and the eye of the spectator everywhere at once. When we imagine a thing, or strive to visualize it in the mind or memory, we do it in this way, without the distortion of ordinary perspective. Isometric perspective is therefore more intellectual, more archetypal, it more truly renders the mental image -- the thing seen by the mind's eye.'"*
- This is interesting to me because of its potential to be abused.   I'm not saying axonometric projection is the ideal method to subvert or deceive, but it does connote a certain _techne_. A few days ago I wrote that I wanted to take advantage of form to deceive—that I am interested in the "dark side" of computing. I'm interested in a person's assumptions/comfort based on familiar package, and how easy it is to fake that package. I'm interested in exploited what is referred to as "intuition" in UI.
- Joe Kendall has me slightly interested in this because there is a certain question about it all: "Why doesn't the average person know about this? How can we protect ourselves from these types of things when we have no idea how they operate?" All that sort of relates back to conversations I was having with Asher Mones last semester and papers I wrote for Walid: about the opacity of everything happening on the web and the potential to exploit it. 
- Back to the thoughts on isometry, I feel like this single article did a lot to elucidate things for me. Isometry seems like an ideal form because it is independent of time and position: it is something that is disorientated (and thus disorientating). It represents a certain horizontality in this way. 
-- Is horizontality disorientating?
- Also that it lends itself to a digital format so well, continues a chapter on "scrollability".
- Also that is so closely associated with "fact" makes it a candidate for "pseudo-math" → something else I want to explore. Or internal geometry/logic. I'm not sure about those, I haven't given them much thought. Maybe they should be next.

*in fact...*
## Pseudo-math/Internal Logic
*Why does it seem important to portray your images in the form of science or math or charts?*
A lot of it, I think, has to do with the idea of containers (see notes on **Textual Impermanence, Day 2**). The form of math or charts carries with it a certain legitimacy. It makes it easier to deceive.

*Then why it important to deceive?*
I'm not really sure. I've kind of lost myself. What is it I'm thinking about again?

If we're talking about historical revisionism, the revision needs to be believable. Similarly, farce needs to be done in such a way that everyone is aware you are joking but they are interested enough to suspend that and believe (if only momentarily). Deceiving only seems important to me, then, if I am actually the one revising history. **OR** if I want to enable other revise history. I should return to my notes from IDS about history ( **IDS - Tired of Hearing About Archives.pdf**). I think there was some fruitful stuff there, and it could help clear my thinking about all this.

Basically, if I recall correctly, I have a general frustration with history because of its flexibility. History is not the past, its an incomplete subjective narrative. That's why I sort of hate "the archive" too: it pretends to be a complete story (or assumes the role of the victim, preserving history against external forces) when it, like anything else, is a selected narrative. It is, for all intents and purposes, impossible to be complete when it comes to recounting history.
I suppose, then, that my interest in deceit is take advantage of that pliability. To rewrite histories with my own agenda in mind.

At some point, I disavowed history: a slight idea to never discuss the past in historical terms again. I never really developed that plan. It came up in notes about flags (see **Flags Part 2.pdf**)

You know, maybe I just never understood the archive. Maybe this is what those artists were doing all along: subversive plans *decades* in the making.

It's funny, because myths are often absurd and *un*believable.
